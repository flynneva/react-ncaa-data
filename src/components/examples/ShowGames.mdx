### Configure Proxy

As stated in [the README](https://flynneva.github.io/react-ncaa-data/readme), make sure you have configured your proxy before trying this example yourself.

### Use NCAA Hook

The NCAA React Component library provides preconfigured hooks for you to use to get data into your site. These should just work out of the box and provide to you the data you need.

import { Playground } from 'docz'
import { NCAA } from '../NCAA'

import ShowGames from './ShowGames'

<Playground>
  <NCAA>
    <ShowGames />
  </NCAA>
</Playground>
