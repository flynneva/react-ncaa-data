### Configure Proxy

As stated in [the README](https://flynneva.github.io/react-ncaa-data/readme), make sure you have configured your proxy before trying this example yourself.

### Get Box Score from specific game

In order to get the boxscore (or any game-specific data) you will need to know the `game ID` referencing that specific game. You can obtain this from getting the 'scoreboard' from a specific day as shown in the `Show Games` example.

import { Playground } from 'docz'
import { NCAA } from '../NCAA'

import ShowBoxScore from './ShowBoxScore'

<Playground>
  <NCAA>
    <ShowBoxScore />
  </NCAA>
</Playground>
